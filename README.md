<<<<<<< HEAD
Java (JavaFX, SWT, Swing), Scala small study projects

BSUIR tasks, VMSIS team, 15 variant.

Here you can find study projects, which I create for learning Cross Platform Programming. 
lab001-lab004 written on Java, lab005-lab008 - Scala.

lab001:
  - for GUI used Swing. GUI created without any special SceneBuilder. Just oldschool, just code GUI!
  - task: create day of week calculator. I used special Java library, java.util.calendar.
  - here only two classes, Main and DayOfWeekCalculator (GUI+logic).
  
 lab002:
  - for GUI used JavaFX.
  - task: training OOP. We plant a flower (rose), water it and smell the bud. Only this order.
  - here more than two classes. Wow! it may be amazing.
  
 lab003:
  - for GUI used JavaFX. 
  - continue training OOP. Here we add abstract class and some useless child classes. 
  - it is rebuilded second lab. But it is secret.
  
 lab004:
   - for GUI used SWT (which created just for Eclipse). Please, don't try do this yourselves, because Eclipse + SWT = pain. Sorry, but it is truth.
   - multithreading training. Standard produser and consumer task with my own buffer. 
  
Bonus: you can find Javadoc everywhere! It sometimes useful.
