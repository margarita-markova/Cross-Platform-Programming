# day-of-week-calculator
Java, Swing project, which was created for Cross-Platforming Programming lab 1, BSUIR, VMSIS. 

Task: create a JFrame with simple GUI, that can calculate day of week (monday, tuesday, etc). User enters the year and the number of day 
(for example, 124), presses on the button and receives result. App is frozen for a 30 seconds. Then app restarts and clear all user's 
inputs. 

I used java.util.Calendar library for easy-to-understand logic of program.
